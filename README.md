## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass/SCSS
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- I could use either the img element and the srcset attribute for the image, but I went with just the img element and the Bootstrap class img-fluid.

- I could have used Boostrap card classes for the entire page, meaning including the lists. But I opeted not to use the Boostrap classes  list-group and list-group-item for better visual look that matches the design.

- I found a helpful site to help calculate image aspect-ratio 

- And I discovered the use of ul::mark to make it easier to style list-style bullets.

- First time use of `text-wrap:balance;` for headings to make them distribute wording more evenly 


### Continued development

- Daily tutorials and projects in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap, Sass/SCSS. For now, in time I will go re-learn React ect.
